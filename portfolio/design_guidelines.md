# UX/UI Designer Portfolio - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Inspired by Moritz Oesterlau's minimal portfolio design (https://www.moritzoesterlau.de). Focus on extreme minimalism, clean typography, and generous white space that lets the work speak for itself.

## Core Design Elements

**Light Mode:**
- Primary: 220 15% 15% (charcoal)
- Secondary: 220 10% 50% (medium gray)
- Background: 0 0% 98% (off-white)
- Accent: 220 100% 60% (professional blue)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: 0 0% 95% (off-white)
- Secondary: 220 10% 70% (light gray)
- Background: 220 15% 8% (deep charcoal)
- Accent: 220 100% 70% (bright blue)

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, professional sans-serif

- **Hierarchy**: 
  - H1: 3.5rem (56px) font-bold
  - H2: 2.25rem (36px) font-semibold
  - H3: 1.5rem (24px) font-medium
  - Body: 1rem (16px) font-normal
  - Small: 0.875rem (14px) font-normal

### Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 4, 8, 16, and 24 (p-4, m-8, gap-16, py-24)
- Consistent 24-unit vertical rhythm between major sections
- 16-unit spacing for component separation
- 8-unit for related elements
- 4-unit for tight groupings

### Component Library

**Navigation**
- Ultra-minimal header: name/title on left, 2-3 simple links on right
- No sticky behavior or backdrop blur
- Clean typography only, no visual elements

**Personal Introduction**
- Circular profile photo with friendly greeting "Hi, I'm [Name] ðŸ‘‹"
- Single paragraph introduction focusing on experience and passion
- No elaborate hero sections or full-screen elements

**Project Cards**
- Single column layout for maximum focus
- Minimal hover effects, primarily typography-based
- Large project images with simple overlay text
- Clear, straightforward project descriptions

**Case Study Layout**
- Single column, generous whitespace
- Image galleries with lightbox functionality
- Process documentation with clear visual hierarchy
- Before/after comparisons and wireframe displays

**Forms**
- Minimal contact form with floating labels
- Clean input styling with subtle focus states
- Professional validation messaging

### Visual Treatment

**Gradients** (used sparingly):
- Subtle background gradients: 220 20% 96% to 240 15% 98%
- Accent overlays: 220 100% 60% to 240 80% 70%

**Background Treatments**:
- Primarily clean whites/off-whites with subtle texture
- Geometric accent elements in corners or as dividers
- Soft shadows and subtle depth through elevation

### Animations
- Smooth scroll behavior throughout
- Fade-in animations for content sections on scroll
- Hover transitions on interactive elements (0.3s ease)
- Page transitions with subtle slide effects

### Images
**Hero Section**: Large, high-quality lifestyle image of designer workspace or abstract geometric composition (1920x800px)
**Project Thumbnails**: Consistent aspect ratio mockups (16:10 or 4:3)
**Case Study Images**: Full-width process documentation, wireframes, and final designs
**About Section**: Professional headshot or workspace photography

### Key Principles
1. **White Space Mastery**: Generous spacing to create breathing room
2. **Subtle Sophistication**: Refined details without overwhelming the content
3. **Content-First**: Design serves the portfolio work, never competes with it
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information thoughtfully as users engage
5. **Professional Polish**: Every interaction feels smooth and intentional
